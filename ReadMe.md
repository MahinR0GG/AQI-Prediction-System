## 📌 Problem Statement
Air pollution has a significant impact on human health and the environment. Predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on pollutant concentrations helps assess pollution levels and enables early preventive measures. This project aims to build a predictive system that estimates AQI using machine learning techniques.
